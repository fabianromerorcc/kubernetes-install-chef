# Kubernetes Recipes (Cookbooks)

Chef recipes for installing Kubernetes on Ubuntu 14 with a single node (master - minion)

# Requirements

- Ubuntu 14
- Git
- User with root access (I'm using root here)
- /bin/bash as login shell
- ChefDK (Installing directions down below)

# Usage
`TODO` - Improve recipe to avoid using root

First, switch to root:
```
sudo su -
```

## ChefDK Installation
Download the ChefDK
```
wget https://packages.chef.io/files/stable/chefdk/1.2.22/ubuntu/14.04/chefdk_1.2.22-1_amd64.deb
```
Install
```
sudo dpkg -i chefdk_1.2.22-1_amd64.deb
```
Environment variables config for Chef
```
source <(chef shell-init bash) && \
echo 'source <(chef shell-init bash)' >> ~/.bash_profile
```

## Recipe installation
Clone repo and cd into folder
```
git clone http://rocarras.uchile.cl:9000/faromero/kubernetes-recipes.git && cd kubernetes-recipes
```

## Run recipe
Finally, run the following command to start with cluster installation
```
chef-client -z -o kubernetes_install
```

## Verify installation
Get a list of installed pods:
```
kubectl get pods
```
It should list at least two services: busybox and kubernetes-bootcamp. Something like:
```
NAME                                  READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
busybox                               1/1       Running   1          4d
kubernetes-bootcamp-390780338-nbb8l   1/1       Running   1          4d
```
Probably in your case those pods could be in a "Container Creating" status. It means that Kubernetes is still installing, maybe downloading docker images of those services. Wait a few seconds and try to get a list of the pods again.
